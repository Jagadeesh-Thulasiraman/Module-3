# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

##  Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

##  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

##  Program

```python


L = [153, 147, 124, 102]
total = sum(L)
print(total)
```

## Output
